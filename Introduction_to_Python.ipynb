    "### 1.1 Introduction to Python\n",
    "Python was created in 1990 by Guido van Rossu as a general-purpose and high-level programming language. It has become extremely popular over the past decade because of its intuitive nature, flexibility, and versatility. According to the Developer Nation's recent 30,000 developer survey, Python is among the top three programming language choices of 2023. Python was rated the most popular in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I hope that this class can show you the charm of Python and motivate you to continue the learning of this great programming language and its associated libraries for data science and machine learning.\n",
